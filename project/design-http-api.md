## PUT and POST

What is the semantic different between PUT and POST? Usual (incorrect) answer
is that _POST should be used to create a resource, while PUT should be used
for updating it_.

- search for `PUT POST RFC`
- you would find RFC 7231 _Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Semantics and Content_
